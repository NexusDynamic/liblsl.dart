# liblsl dart Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) library

This package provides a Dart wrapper for liblsl, using the dart native-assets build system and ffi.


## Testing

Currently (March 2025), the native assets are branch blocked so you will need to use flutter / dart "main" channel to work with this lib.

```bash
dart --enable-experiment=native-assets test
```
